## **Architecture**

The app is structured using the **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern:

1. **Model**:  
   Represents the data structure (e.g., `Course` model with `completion` and `progress` properties).  

2. **View**:  
   Handles UI components like `UITableView`, `UISearchBar`, and other visual elements.  

3. **ViewModel**:  
   Contains the app logic, such as managing todos, filtering data, and saving/loading to UserDefaults.
